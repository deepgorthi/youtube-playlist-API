Once the username is extracted, give it as an argument to get_playlist_times.py file.

```bash
$ python3 get_playlist_times.py AmazonWebServices
```

Inspired by @CoreyMSchafer's series on Youtube API. While Corey goes through how to use the Youtube API, I extended it to get the total times of each playlist in a given channel.
